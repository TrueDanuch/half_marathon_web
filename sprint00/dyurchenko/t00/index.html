    <h2 id="what_superhero">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a 
        superhero,<b> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use 
        that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br> 
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a 
        good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal 
        human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

    <p>Flash(Barry Allen)</p>
    <p>Barry Allen is an assistant scientist from the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of Central City Police Department. Barry had a reputation 
        for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which frustrated his fiancée, Iris West. One night, as he was preparing to leave work, a freak 
        lightning bolt struck a nearby shelf in his lab and doused him with a cocktail of unnamed chemicals. As a result, Barry found that he could run extremely
        fast and had matching reflexes.</p>
